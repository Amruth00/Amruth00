1. GSM SIM900A → Arduino Uno

Use SoftwareSerial: D10 & D11

GSM Pin	Arduino Pin

TXD	D10 (Arduino RX)
RXD	D11 (Arduino TX)
GND	GND


⚠ IMPORTANT

GSM must be powered by 12V 1A or 12V 2A adapter.

Do NOT power GSM from Arduino 5V.


If GSM is not powered properly → SMS will not come.

🌡️ 2. DHT11 Temperature Sensor → Arduino

DHT11 Pin	Arduino Pin

VCC	5V
DATA	D3
GND	GND


(Some sensors already have a pull-up resistor; if not, add 10k between DATA–VCC.)


---

🌱 3. Soil Moisture Sensor → Arduino

Soil Sensor Pin	Arduino Pin

VCC	5V
GND	GND
AOUT	A0


This sensor gives value 0–1023.

✔ High value = Dry
✔ Low value = Wet

🔊 4. Sound Sensor (HW-484 v0.2) → Arduino

Sound Pin	Arduino Pin

VCC	5V
GND	GND
A0	A1 (analog sound level)
D0	D2 (digital detection)



---

🚨 5. Buzzer → Arduino

Buzzer Pin	Arduino Pin

+	D7
–	GND


Used only when soil is dry.


---

⚡ 6. Relay Module → Arduino

Relay Pin	Arduino Pin

IN	D9
VCC	5V
GND	GND


👉 Arduino D9 controls motor ON/OFF.


---

🌀 7. Motor + Relay + Battery (MOST IMPORTANT)

Relay Terminals:

COM (Common)

NO (Normally Open)

NC (Normally Closed — not used)


Correct motor connection:

Relay Terminal	Connect To

COM	Motor +
NO	Battery + (12V)
Motor –	Battery –
Battery –	Arduino GND (COMMON GROUND)


Why?

When relay is OFF → NO is open → Motor OFF
When relay is ON → NO connects → Motor gets power → Motor ON


---

🟧 8. POWER SUPPLY RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

✔ GSM: 12V 1A or 2A
✔ Motor: 9–12V external battery
✔ Arduino: USB or 5V
✔ All GND must be connected together

GSM GND → Arduino GND  
Motor Battery – → Arduino GND  
Soil/Sound/DHT11 GND → Arduino GND

Without common GND → GSM won’t communicate, relay won’t switch, sensors give wrong values.

🌟 FULL CONNECTION SUMMARY (Short)

Arduino Uno Pins

A0 → Soil Sensor
A1 → Sound Analog
D2 → Sound Digital
D3 → DHT11
D7 → Buzzer
D9 → Relay IN
D10 → GSM TX
D11 → GSM RX
5V → All sensors + Relay VCC
GND → All sensor grounds + Relay GND + GSM GND + Motor Battery –
